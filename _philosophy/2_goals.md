body: "Our fundamental goal is to advance understanding of how the world works. In particular, we study how genomes evolve and function. We believe that the best way to pursue this goal is through open and welcoming scientific practices that engage with diverse perspectives. Thus, mentoring and training one another is an essential component of our mission, along with the communication of our results to broad audiences beyond specialists. Our main goal is NOT to publish a paper in Science, obtain a faculty job, or make millions of dollars. While we hope all of these happen if you want them, they are side effects of and secondary to our fundamental goal. When we lose sight of this, bad things are likely to happen."

- description: "Random Forest classifier designed to predict pairs of human genes capable to causing a digenic disease when carrying rare variants simultaneously. DiGePred has been trained using digenic pairs from DIDA and non-digenic pairs from unaffected relatives of individuals with rare undiagnosed disease."

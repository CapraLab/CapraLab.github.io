- description: "COSMIS is a new framework for quantification of the constraint on protein-coding genetic variation in 3D spatial neighborhoods. It leverages recent advances in computational structure prediction, large-scale sequencing data from gnomAD, and a mutation-spectrum-aware statistical model."

description: "Hannah Takasuka is a DDS/PhD student in the Oral and Craniofacial Sciences Program. She is a 2022 graduate of Johns Hopkins University with majors in biomedical engineering and Spanish. Prior to UCSF, she conducted academic and industry research in cell biology, tissue engineering, and hardware/software development of medical devices. She also underwent orthognathic (corrective jaw) surgery, experiencing first-hand how a severely dysfunctional and unaesthetic orthodontic bite can negatively affect both physical and mental health. This inspired her to shift her focus and pursue studies in dentistry and oral sciences.  She is currently exploring dental electronic health record data and leveraging medical electronic health record data to quantify maternal comorbidities for mothers who deliver early preterm (<32 weeks gestational age), late preterm (32-36 weeks), spontaneous preterm (labor and delivery not induced by a doctor), or medically-indicated preterm (induced by a doctor). Outside of research, Hannah enjoys running, soccer, rock climbing, Christian fellowship, learning languages, and community service/advocacy."

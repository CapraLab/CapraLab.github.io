description: "Yaen (Yah-En) is a PhD student in the Biological and Medical Informatics program at UCSF. She works on exploring the contributions of Neanderthal introgressed genomic regions in moderns humans and how they affect structural/functional brain phenotypes, along with psychiatric disease risk. Before joining UCSF, she graduated from Northeastern University with a Bachelor's in Behavioral Neuroscience and a minor in Data Science, studied tau biology at AbbVie, and conducted neuroimaging research though Northeastern University's Music, Imaging and Neural Dynamics Laboratory and Massachusetts General Hospital's Eating Disorder Research and Clinical Program. Today, she continues to advocate for diversity in research, increased mental health awareness, and hopes to be a mentor in the spaces she is a part of. Outside of the lab, you can find Yaen being a guest in the Bay Area hip-hop dance community, exploring San Francisco on her bike, playing too much Candy Crush, and crafting."
